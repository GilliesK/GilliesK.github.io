title: About Myself
---
I am a physics Ph.D. candidate at Brown University. Before Brown, I graduated with a BA in physics from Clark University. 

I am originally from Cote d'ivoire and grew up in Pennsylvania.  

### What I study:
I study how patterns and organization show up in systems that are noisy, disordered, or strongly interacting. A lot of what I’m interested in happens in situations where the usual ideas about order don’t quite work, so the behavior of the system ends up being influenced by things like rare events, long-range correlations, and complicated energy landscapes. I do a mixture of devopling my own theories, algorithms, and experiments to explore how randomness can sometimes disrupt order and sometimes help produce it, and how transitions between different behaviors can happen in unexpected ways. More generally, I’m interested in the mathematical ideas (e.g., probability and scaling) that help explain how large-scale structure can emerge from messy, microscopic dynamics, with links to problems in optimization, learning, and other complex systems.
