title: About Myself
---
I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University. Before Brown, I graduated with a BA in physics from Clark University. 

I am originally from Cote d'ivoire and grew up in Pennsylvania.  

### What I study:
I study how randomness and long-range interactions govern the emergence of order in complex systems, using statistical mechanics, stochastic modeling, and large-scale computation. My work centers on spin glasses, random-field models, and renormalization-group theory—systems where disorder competes with collective behavior to produce unexpected phases.
I'm motivated by the mathematical structures underlying phase transitions: how probability theory and real analysis describe the spontaneous organization that arises from noise. I'm also interested in translating these ideas beyond condensed matter—how concepts like energy landscapes, metastability, and replica symmetry breaking from spin-glass theory connect to neural networks, optimization algorithms, and stochastic processes in quantitative fields.
