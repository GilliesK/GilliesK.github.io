title: About Myself
---
I am a physics Ph.D. candidate at Brown University. Before Brown, I graduated with a BA in physics from Clark University. 

I am originally from Cote d'ivoire and grew up in Pennsylvania.  

### What I study:
I study how collective order and phase transitions emerge in systems where disorder and thermal fluctuations play a central role, particularly in low dimensions where the standard symmetry-breaking framework is no longer sufficient. Much of my work focuses on identifying the effective degrees of freedom—such as defects or domain structures—and understanding how their interactions control large-scale behavior through renormalization-group flows. Using a combination of analytical arguments, numerical simulations, and self-made microfluidic experiments, I investigate how marginal interactions and quenched disorder reshape critical behavior, including how randomness can both suppress and stabilize order and how sharp transitions can survive in unconventional forms. More broadly, I’m interested in questions of universality: how complex microscopic dynamics organize into simple macroscopic descriptions, and what this reveals about interacting systems across physics and related fields.
