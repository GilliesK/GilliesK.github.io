title: About Myself
---
I am a physics Ph.D. student at Brown University. Before Brown, I graduated with a BA in physics from Clark University. 

I am originally from Cote d'ivoire and grew up in Pennsylvania.  

### What I study:
I am broadly interested in how disorder, fluctuations, and long-range interactions shape the emergence of order in complex systems.
I approach these problems through a blend of statistical mechanics, stochastic modeling, and high-performance computation, with particular focus on spin-glass physics, random-field models, and renormalization-group theory.

I am drawn to the connections between probability theory, real analysis, and physics, especially in understanding how collective behavior arises from randomness.
Beyond traditional condensed-matter contexts, I am interested in how ideas from spin-glass theory, random matrices, and stochastic processes can inform machine learning, optimization, and quantitative modelingâ€”for instance, how concepts like metastability, energy landscapes, and replica symmetry breaking translate to neural networks or market dynamics.
